# Mock Stocks
Created for our grade 12 Computer Science class final project. Mock Stocks is a basic stock portfolio creation game created with Java. Its purpose is to teach its users the basics of creating a stock portfolio.

## Topic/Focus
A single-player fantasy finance game in which the user can create and manage their own stock portfolio. The player fills their portfolio with 5 different sectors, and in each sector, they are allowed to invest in 5 different instruments. 

Stocks have varying properties, as some may be safe and low-risk, whilst others may be high-risk, high reward. Users also have the ability to trade their stocksâ€™ value for stocks in a different instrument within the same sector, or take the profit/loss and purchase a new stock. 

The player starts with $10,000 and their goal is to reach $100,000 in the least amount of time. Their score is based on how long they take in days, and a loss will be returned when the user reaches a total capital of $0.
